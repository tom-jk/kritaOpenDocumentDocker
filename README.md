# Open Documents Docker
A Krita docker that provides a compact list of your open images and can switch between them.

# Motivation
When you have many images open, the horizontal tab bar can become cramped and awkward to navigate.

The goal with ODD is to fit more files on screen at once, be quicker to navigate, and easier to scan by showing the images rather than their names.

# Overview

Display documents as text or thumbnails.

Layout as list or grid, vertical and horizontal.

Support for multiple views and windows.

Context menu with new options: revert, quick copy merged, view management options.

UI/UX: includes kinetic list scrolling, tabbed settings panel, and filtering docker by window.

# Basic usage
Left-click on the thumbnail of an image to switch to it.

Right-click for a menu of common file actions: save, save as, export, etc.

The list will automatically add and remove items as files are created, opened and closed.

# Status
Pre-release, expect quirks.
