<h3>Open Documents Docker</h3>

 A Krita docker that provides a compact vertical list of your open images and can switch between them.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>Left-click on the thumbnail of an image to switch to it.</p>
<p>Right-click for a menu of common file actions: save, save as, export, etc.</p>
<p>The list will automatically add and remove items as files are created, opened and closed.</p>
<p>The list will not automatically update thumbnails as you edit images, but you can manually with the refresh button.</p>
